Oauth:
User authorizes one website to do something at another website.
- e.g. give a website access to your dropbox to store or retrieve files.
- also use oauth to login.
- it mainly just sends the general info about the user to the website.
- can also give a website to post as you.

Two most common ways to do oauth:
Inflight credentials
- more secure but requires server.
Implicit
- better for frontend, less secure.

Oauth1
- requries hmac signatures
Oauth2
- requires only https
